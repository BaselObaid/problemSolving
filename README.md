## Minimum Absolute Difference

**Problem Description:**

[Minimum Absolute Difference on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference/)

Given an array of distinct integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

**Solution:**

- [Java Solution](./src/Solution.java)

**Submission:**

- [LeetCode Submission](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1112204293/)

**Explanation:**

I used the following approach:

1. Sort the array to simplify finding the minimum absolute difference.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and find pairs with the minimum absolute difference.
3. Add the pairs to the result list.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: O(n log n) - due to sorting.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space for variables.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or improvements!
